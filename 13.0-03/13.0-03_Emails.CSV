Can you let Bob know? He may need to adjust the engineering schedule. I can do the handover with Andrew, then redo one for you when you are back.

Don’t think the spec will be ready for handover this week, unfortunately. I am still working on it, then it needs to go for management approval.

Make sure the asynch request type and new master config IDs go into that file as well.

 

Initial tech design notes are located at:

A few so far:

 

1.       What’s the plan regarding archiving the cif checker result files?

2.       What should happen to a results file when the original file gets “deleted” by the user.

3.       The “View checkCIF Results”  link logic (such as described in section 2.6) makes reference to “un-hidden” files. What user interface action(s) correspond to “hiding” a file?

4.       What about site cleanout? (probably clean those files out too, but it should be spelled out in the spec)

Hi Caroline

 

A few so far:

 

1.      What’s the plan regarding archiving the cif checker result files?

Didn’t think about this... What do we do with Reference Checking marked up and cleaned-up Word files? Should probably do the same thing. My guess is archive it when the original file is archived.

2.      What should happen to a results file when the original file gets “deleted” by the user.

Whatever we do with reference checking marked up and cleaned up word files. Most likely delete.

3.      The “View checkCIF Results”  link logic (such as described in section 2.6) makes reference to “un-hidden” files. What user interface action(s) correspond to “hiding” a file?

File Inventory, Hide link next to Companion file, in Companion Files grid. Only Companion Files can be hidden. Goes into Hidden Companion Files grid. There is a screen shot of this in spec. Didn’t discuss replacing Companion file – when you click Replace link (also on File Inventory in Companion Files grid), you are uploading a new Companion file to replace the old one. Uploading the new companion file should trigger the checkCIF (if configured for the Item Type being uploaded). The replaced companion file goes into the Hidden Companion files grid. A Hidden file should retain its results PDF, because it can be restored using the ‘Restore’ link.

4.      What about site cleanout? (probably clean those files out too, but it should be spelled out in the spec)

5.      Clean out the results PDF when the original file is cleaned out,  check into what we do with Reference checking marked up and cleaned up Word files.

 

 

Here is a screen shot of file Inventory showing the Hide and Restore links for Companion Files.

OK.

 

Also, looking at the Details page layout, items to display (SelectItemsToDisplay.aspx) – data gathering is hard-coded within the page and doesn’t use the framework.  Should this be changed or just leave it be?

"RE: 13.0-03 export/transmittal question","I think that would be a future enhancement. The results files are not “submission files” or “Companion  Files” per se. 

 

They should be incorporated into the transmitted zip files if selected, but I don’t think there is a requirement to change the XSLTs for the XML metadata files (JATS, NLM 3.0, etc).  However they should be listed in the go.xml file created for production task transmittals  as a <file-name> in since they are part of the zip file.

 

I will clarify this in the spec.

 

Thanks! - Caroline

Hi Caroline

 

Before I put a bunch of time into designing and implementing this, is there a requirement to write out metadata about the CIF result files in the various production task exports/transmittals?

Is appearance of cif file results in the assignment files listing dependent on the cifcheck enabled configuration?

"RE: 13.0-03 2.10.1","Hi Jean,

 

Sounds like you are talking about a use case where checkCIF was enabled for a journal (and results were obtained), and then the journal turned checkCIF off. I’d say this is an edge case, and if we have checkCIF PDFs, go ahead and display them.

 

Thanks- Caroline

"13.0-03 questions","First, can you acquire credentials for the CIF checker utility soon?

 

Also few more questions have come up:

 

1)      Do we still want to send (correctly configured) companion files uploaded for schedule groups to the CIF checker? If so, there’s not currently a mechanism to display those. The lowest-impact way is probably to add a “CIF Results” link to a schedule group grid and re-use the CIF results page that will be developed for submissions.

2)      In section 2.3.1.1, there is one set of customizable CIF check instructions (to be displayed on the CIF Results page), but the default instructions are different for the author/reviewer and editor/publisher versions of the CIF results page. Do we want to have two different customizable instructions instead, or consolidate?

Dear Caroline,

 

Please accept our apologies for not realising that the correct documentation hadn't been passed onto you. 

 

The documentation may be found at:

http://publcif.co.uk/checkcif.html

 

The documentation notes a userid and password as part of the specification. For 

testing purposes your may use the following:

userid=AriesTest

passcode=Aries123

 

I have attached two example CIF files (one quick, one more complex and slower to run). I have also attached an output PDF file for each.

 

We look forward to working with you over the coming months.

 

With best wishes,

Mike

We are in the coding stage now! We will be sending some tests using the credentials you gave us below.

 

Would it be possible to get some more sample cif files?

 

Also, just following up on whether you have a graphic that you want us to use. Can you let us know if there is one and when we can expect it?

 

I have added our 2 coding engineers to the email string.

 

Thanks!

Subject: 13.0-03 questions

 

First, can you acquire credentials for the CIF checker utility soon?

Sent these in a separate email.

 

Also few more questions have come up:

 

1)      Do we still want to send (correctly configured) companion files uploaded for schedule groups to the CIF checker? If so, there’s not currently a mechanism to display those. The lowest-impact way is probably to add a “CIF Results” link to a schedule group grid and re-use the CIF results page that will be developed for submissions.

CW: This was a spec oversight. In addition to adding the results files to submission File Inventory, I meant to add them to Schedule Group File Inventory. ScheduleGroupFIleInventory.aspx. Is this possible? 

 

They *are* currently spec’ed to be included on Schedule Group Production Task Assignment page – but this is one of the pages we are dropping, right?

2)      In section 2.3.1.1, there is one set of customizable CIF check instructions (to be displayed on the CIF Results page), but the default instructions are different for the author/reviewer and editor/publisher versions of the CIF results page. Do we want to have two different customizable instructions instead, or consolidate?

Whatever is easier to code. You are right, 2 sets of custom instructions is better, but I don’t think we have to have it.

 

3)      What do we want the text for the “%CHECKCIF_RESULTS_PDF% link to be?

View checkCIF Results PDF . This is populated in an HTML letter only, right? Otherwise they see the url, I think.

That’s correct, we’re dropping that page. We can add a results link to the schedule group file inventory without any problems.

2)      In section 2.3.1.1, there is one set of customizable CIF check instructions (to be displayed on the CIF Results page), but the default instructions are different for the author/reviewer and editor/publisher versions of the CIF results page.

Whatever is easier to code. You are right, 2 sets of custom instructions is better, but I don’t think we have to have it.

 

There’s no significant extra time involved in doing two sets of instructions, so we can do that.

 

What do we want the text for the “%CHECKCIF_RESULTS_PDF% link to be?

View checkCIF Results PDF . This is populated in an HTML letter only, right? Otherwise they see the url, I think.

Works for me.

I am pretty sure we talked about “Aries”. Seems like it should be something more like “Aries Test Journal”. Why don’t we go with Aries Test Journal for now.

Let me know when we are ready for the over the shoulder.

"Adding checkCIF results link to the SG file inventory page","Hi Andrew/Jean,

 

I am updating 13.0-03 for the oversight that Andrew caught – we need to have the checkCIF Results link appear on the Schedule Group file inventory page. However, I realize the actual results popup will need to be slightly different when reached in this way. For example, currently in the spec the checkCIF Results page header shows the MS # and the article title. The page header, the grid names and even the database table where the files are pulled from will need to be adjusted for Schedule Group Companion files.

 

Let me know if you need this design today.


Thanks!

I am revising 13.0-03 to cut scope and finalize the use cases, and I realized there is an inconsistency in the spec regarding the instructions on the checkCIF Results page. 

 

I realized that I provided default instructions on the configuration page but added additional instructions on the results page. Instead, the results page should reflect either 1) the default instructions (if they were not customized on the Configure checkCIF page) or 2) the customized instructions if they were customized on that configuration page.

 

There is no need for a (more…) link.

 

I will correct this in the next version of the spec which I hope to pass to you early this week.

 

Please let me know if the tech spec is ready and when you want to try to have the over the shoulder review.

 

Thanks!

 

Caroline

"Link to checkCIF results in PDF","HI Andrew/Jean,

 

How are we going to code the link to the checkCIF results PDF that appears within the EM PDF? I’m thinking there may be an issue because the EM PDF may be built before the results PDF has been returned from the checkCIF tool. We can build the link to the .cif file itself, but having a separate link for the results PDF is where I am thinking we may have an issue.

 

For Reference Checking, we build a link to the Reference Checking Results page into the PDF, and when the user clicks the link they are directed to the Reference Checking Results page within EM, which displays a message if the RC results are not yet available. If the results are available, they are displayed on the page. We do not provide a link to the marked-up and cleaned-up Word files from the EM PDF.

 

I’m think we may need to build the checkCIF results link for a specific file in a similar way. Have the link direct to an EM page behind the scenes - when the user clicks the link, the EM page determines whether the results PDF is actually available or not. If it is available, it downloads. If it is not available, the user receives an EM page that lets them know that the results PDF is not yet available.

 

Have you guys gotten to this part of the spec yet?

"RE: Link to checkCIF results in PDF","It is better to put the link in, but we need to check the rules we use to determine when to put in the View Reference Checking Results link. For example, if the file has not yet reached a workflow trigger point when the PDF is being built, then the Results PDF link shouldn’t be in there either, even though the file itself is in there. This would mimic what would happen with a Word file that is built into the original PDF but not configured to go to the RC tool until Revision.  If the file is configured to go to the tool when the PDF is being built, my guess is especially for the Reviewer PDF, the results file will exist by the time the reviewer clicks on it. However, it is possible that it won’t exist right after the Author builds it, if the Author goes back into the PDF and clicks on it.

 

Let’s check out the logic we use for Reference Checking…

"RE: Link to checkCIF results in PDF","I guess I did cover this in the spec already J.

 

I am eliminating discrepancies for the default instructions for the results page. I had about 3 different versions of them. Since they are tokenized, we can just change the default English for the token when I pass you the latest version of the spec. If you need them earlier, let me know.

 

FYI I am off Monday through Thurs next week; in on Friday of next week.

"13.0-03, section 2.3.2","Caroline,

 

Working on the submission item type edit page and can’t see anything in the spec (section 2.3.2), that indicates what should happen when the ‘file is cif’ checkbox is already checked and saved and the pdf handling item is changed and/or the external resource status is changed which would make the ‘file is cif’ no longer enabled.  You are indicating that the checkbox should be ‘nulled out’.  Does this mean, in this case, it should be set to unchecked?

Caroline,

 

Working on the submission item type edit page and can’t see anything in the spec (section 2.3.2), that indicates what should happen when the ‘file is cif’ checkbox is already checked and saved and the pdf handling item is changed and/or the external resource status is changed which would make the ‘file is cif’ no longer enabled.  You are indicating that the checkbox should be ‘nulled out’.  Does this mean, in this case, it should be set to unchecked?

"New version of 13.0-03 CheckCIF attached - please use for coding and  Round 1 testing","Hi Andrew/Jean,

 

Please find attached version 7 of spec 13.0-03 checkCIF API.

 

Andrew brought it to my attention that the Schedule Group File Inventory page was not included in the earlier versions of the spec. I have added the Schedule Group File Inventory page as I discussed with Andrew. I have also brought the design of this page into congruence with the design of the Submission File Inventory page. This is desirable but if it is not possible to do under the current LOEE let me know. The checkCIF Results link is added to this page under certain conditions.

 

I have also moved several sections of the spec to the ‘Possible Future Development’ section. Bob had proposed eliminating the deep link merge field, but Richard and Lyndon did not approve this change, so the deep link merge field must remain as part of the spec to be implemented in version 13.0.

 

I am out next Mon through Thurs – I am back in on Friday. If there are questions please consult Tony or Sally, unless they can wait for my return.

 

Thanks!

 

Caroline

"13.0-03 status/schedule group file inventory question","Hi Caroline

 

We’ll be ready for the OTS early next week.

 

Also, did you get around to putting a section in the spec covering schedule group file inventory?

"RE: 13.0-03 status/schedule group file inventory question","Yes, that section is in the version of the spec I sent last Friday. Re-attached here.

 

I think Jean may have had a question about the checkCIF results page that allows a file to be sent to checkCIF using the checkCIF: Selected Files button. It should function like the page in AQC that has the Resend button. I don’t believe that page closes when the files are re-sent. The AQC page also does not refresh with the new statuses and results , but it would be best of the checkCIF results page *did* refresh when the results are returned. At the time we coded the AQC page we did not have the option to refresh the page automatically. Let me know if you need more details on this.

I will schedule the OTS – thanks!

"Changes to Check CIF Results Link in FG Controllers","Andrew,

 

Saw that there were several changes after I left yesterday regards the controllers for the FG grids.  I tested all of these yesterday before our over-the-shoulder meeting and they allwere showing the result link correctly.  The New Submissions Requiring Assignment grid was missed I think – I just noticed that it is no longer showing the link.

 

I’m sure you understand, it’s difficult to test/code these things and then see them not working again so I am going to beg off doing any testing/coding unless directly assigned by you specifically, OK.  I think I’m wasting my time in doing the testing/coding if things are just going to change thereafter.  

 

Right now on my list is

                Tech Check not showing the results link

                Details page not showing the results link

                Custom instructions not showing on check results page.

 

If you are making any changes that might affect these pages/processes, please let me know and I’ll forgo doing anything with them until you’ve finished.  I’m off on Monday and will return to the list above on Tuesday.

 

Thanks,
